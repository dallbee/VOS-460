Write a C++ program to simulate a simple 16-bit CPU or Virtual Machine (VM) consisting of 4 general purpose registers (r[0]-r[3]) a program counter (pc), an instruction register (ir), a status register (sr), a stack pointer (sp), a clock, an arithmetic and logic unit (ALU), a 256 word memory (mem) with base and limit registers, and a disk. 
The registers are represented by a vector of 4 integers, and mem is represented by a vector of 256 integers:
           class VirtualMachine {
           private:
     		...
                static const int REG_FILE_SIZE = 4;
                static const int MEM_SIZE = 256;
                vector < int > r;
                vector < int > mem;
     		...
           public:
     		...
	   };

           // and later in the constructor
           r = vector < int > (REG_FILE_SIZE);
           mem = vector < int > (MEM_SIZE);
The least significant five bits of sr are reserved for OVERFLOW, LESS, EQUAL, GREATER, and CARRY status in that order, the rest are "don't care" (d): 

  d  	           ...          	   d  	   V  	   L  	   E  	   G  	   C  
15		   5	   4	   3	   2	   1	   0

ALU is part of the logic of your program, disk is represented by a collection of files, and the rest of the components are represented by simple variables in your program:
	int pc, ir, sr, sp, base, limit, clock;
We only use the lower 16 bits of the variables. clock could alternatively be represented by a class.
The VM supports two general formats for the instructions. 

Format 1:
      OP      	 RD	 I	 RS	       UNUSED        
      15:11      	 10:9	 8	 7:6	           5:0      

Format 2:
      OP      	 RD	 I	       ADDR/CONST      
      15:11      	 10:9	 8	               7:0      

where OP (bits 11 to 15 from right to left) stands for opcode, RD (bits 9 and 10) stands for register-destination, I (bit 8) stands for immediate, and RS (bits 6 and 7) stands for register-source. When I is 0, the next 2 bits specify the source register and the next 6 bits are unused. When I is 1, immediate address mode is in effect: depending on the instruction, the next 8 bits are treated as either an unsigned 8 bit address (ADDR), or an 8 bit two's complement constant (CONST). This implies 0 <= ADDR < 256 and -128 <= CONST < 128. If a field is unused, it is considered don't care, and it can be set to any bit pattern. We will set don't cares to all zeros. load and loadi are special instructions, they both use format 2: when I = 0, we use ADDR, when I = 1, we use CONST. 

To simplify writing programs for the VM, we need an assembly language and its corresponding assembler. The following table lists all the instructions supported by the assembler and the VM.

01101	0	 compr RD RS	 if r[RD] < r[RS] set LESS reset EQUAL and GREATER; 
if r[RD] == r[RS] set EQUAL reset LESS and GREATER; 
if r[RD] > r[RS] set GREATER reset EQUAL and LESS	 
01101	1	 compri RD CONST  	 if r[RD] < CONST set LESS reset EQUAL and GREATER; 
if r[RD] == CONST set EQUAL reset LESS and GREATER; 
if r[RD] > CONST set GREATER reset EQUAL and LESS	 
01110	d	 getstat RD	 r[RD] = SR	 
01111	d	 putstat RD	 SR = r[RD]	 
10000	d	 jump ADDR	 pc = ADDR	 
10001	d	 jumpl ADDR	 if LESS == 1, pc = ADDR, else do nothing	 
10010	d	 jumpe ADDR	 if EQUAL == 1, pc = ADDR, else do nothing	 
10011	d	 jumpg ADDR	 if GREATER == 1, pc = ADDR, else do nothing	 
10100	d	 call ADDR	 push VM status; pc = ADDR	 
10101	d	 return	 pop and restore VM status	 
10110	d	 read RD	 read new content of r[RD] from .in file	 
10111	d	 write RD	 write r[RD] into .out file	 
11000	d	 halt	 halt execution	 
11001	d	 noop	 no operation	 

Since mem consist of a set of integers (bits), any program written in the above language has to be translated to its equivalent object code to be loaded in mem and run by the VM. Write an assembler for the above assembly language. For example, when the assembler encounters

           loadi 2 71
it translates the instruction to
           0000010101000111
where from left to right 
00000 represents loadi or load 
10 represents r[2] 
1 represent immediate addressing or I == 1 and therefore loadi is the opcode 
and 01000111 is the CONST.
1351 is the object code for this instruction, since 00000101010001112 = 135110.

As an example, your assembler should produce the following object code on the right for the assembly program on the left. This program does not perform anything meaningful! It is intended to compare some related instructions. Note you may comment the rest of a line using an exclamation point (!). Your assembler should ignore comments. 

Assembly Prog	Object Prog
load 1 69	 581
load 2 69	 1093
loadi 2 -123 ! set register 2	 1413
loadi 2 71	 1351
add 0 3	 4288
addi 0 -56	 4552
jump 10       ! produces runtime error    	 32778
halt	 49152


The assembler reads an assembly program and outputs its corresponding object code. Any assembly program must have a .s suffix. Its corresponding object code must have the same name with a .o suffix. The assembler should create the .o file, and the VM should read in the .o file, store it in memory, and start executing it. The assembler should catch any out-of-range error for ADDR and CONST and stop producing object code. Also any value other than 0, 1, 2, or 3 for RD or RS is illegal; and any opcode other than the ones listed in the above VM Instruction Table is illegal. The assembler should be designed and implemented as a C++ class. 

Next, design and implement a C++ class called VirtualMachine to interpret the object codes. Store the object code to be run in the top of the memory, this implies setting pc and base registers to 0 and limit register to the size of the object program. The VM then enters instruction fetch-execute cycle (an infinite loop): 

TOP:	   ir ← mem[pc] (instruction fetch)
  pc++
  set OP, RD, I, RS, ADDR, CONST from ir
  execute the instruction specified by OP and I (instruction execute)
  go to TOP

This loop terminates when a halt instruction is executed or some unexpected error occurs. Following the above file suffix convention, when executing a .o program and a read instruction is encountered, the input is read from a .in file with the same name. In case of a write instruction the output is printed into a .out file. 

The clock is initialized to 0 at the beginning. Each of load, store, call, and return instructions take 4 clock ticks to execute. Each of read and write instructions take 28 clock ticks to execute. The rest of the instructions take 1 clock tick to execute each. Note that loadi, which is the set instruction and uses an immediate operand, takes 1 clock tick and not 4 ticks as it does not access memory. Print the final value of the clock in the .out file. 

Be careful in handling sign extension. For example, if in loadi instruction CONST = 111111002 = -410, then to store it in some r[RD] register, it must be sign extended to 11111111111111002 (still -410). Sign extension occurs every time a short constant (in this case 8 bits) is assigned to a longer register (in this case 16 bits); look for this every time negative numbers are involved. 

call and return instructions need special attention. As part of the execution of the call instruction the status of the VM must be pushed on to the stack. The status of the VM consist of pc, r[0]-r[3], and sr. The stack grows from the bottom of memory up, therefore initially sp = 256. After a call, sp is decremented by 6 as the values of pc, r[0]-r[3], and sr in the VM are pushed on to the stack. When a return instruction is executed, sp is incremented by 6 as the new values of pc, r[0]-r[3], and sr are popped from the stack and restored in the VM. When sp >= 256 stack is empty, and when sp < limit+6 stack is full. 

noop instruction can be used as a place holder in the memory, for example, to store a temporary value in memory and later retrieve it. Use noop instructions either at the beginning or at the end of the program; do not use them in the middle unless there is a very good reason for doing so. 

You should write your Assembler, VM, and OS in as much as possible in an object oriented and extensible fashion! This is specially the case as new requirements are added from one phase to the next. Use separate compilation for this (large) project. This means the class Assembler must be defined in files:

	Assembler.h
	Assembler.cpp
and the class VirtualMachine must be defined in files:
	VirtualMachine.h
	VirtualMachine.cpp
Compile Assembler.cpp and VirtualMachine.cpp separately using the -c option:
	$ g++ -c Assembler.cpp
	$ g++ -c VirtualMachine.cpp
These two commands produce Assembler.o and VirtualMachine.o. 
os.cpp includes:
	#include "Assembler.h"
	#include "VirtualMachine.h"
	main()
where main() declares instances of Assembler and VirtualMachine and makes the proper calls:
        ...
        #include "Assembler.h"
        #include "VirtualMachine.h"
        ...
        main(int argc, char *argv[])
        {
                Assembler as;
                VirtualMachine vm;
                ...
        } // main
Compile and link to make your rudimentary OS (rudimentary only at this phase!):
	$ g++ -o os os.cpp Assembler.o VirtualMachine.o
and run prog.s in your OS environment:
	$ os prog.s
which assembles prog.s into prog.o, loads prog.o into memory, and finally invokes the virtual machine to run the program. 
Make sure that your program works correctly for test.s program:
        read  0
        loadi 1 -2
        add   0 1      ! subtract 2 from value read
        write 0
        halt
for add5.s program:
        read 0
        call 5
        load 0 8
        write 0
        halt
        addi 0 5       ! add5 function
        store 0 8
        return
        noop           ! location for return value
and for fact.s program:
! main for factorial program
        loadi  0 1     ! line 0, R0 = fact(R1)
        read   1       ! input R1
        call   6       ! call fact
        load   0 33    ! receive result of fact
        write  0
        halt
! fact function
        compri 1 1     ! line 6
        jumpe  14      ! jump over the recursive call to fact if
        jumpl  14      ! R1 is less than or equal 1
        call   16      ! call mult (R0 = R0 * R1)
        load   0 34    ! receive result of mult
        subi   1 1     ! decrement multiplier (R1) and multiply again
        call   6       ! call fact
        load   0 33
        store  0 33    ! line 14, return R0 (result of fact)
        return
! mult function
        loadi  2 8     ! line 16, init R2 (counter)
        loadi  3 0     ! init R3 (result of mult)
        shr    1       ! line 18 (loop), shift right multiplier set CARRY
        store  2 35    ! save counter
        getstat 2      ! to find CARRY's value

        jump   26      ! otherwise do nothing
        add    3 0

        load   2 35    ! restore counter
        subi   2 1     ! decrement counter        
        compri 2 0     ! if counter > 0 jump to loop
